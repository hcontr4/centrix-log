# Centrix Log

## Allows users to track weight, reps, sets and rest periods during a workout. It will have social integration allowing users to view friends' workouts and interact with them. I also want to add workout templating to allow focus on logging variables that are not known before the workout.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

While the foundational component of logging a workout is CRUD, I would like to add features to enhance the users workout such as the following.
Automatic Timer Notifications: Upon logging a set, the app initiates an automatic timer. Once the user's rest period concludes, they receive a notification.
Progressive Overload Tracking: Users can review their past performance right where they log it, ensuring they consistently progress in their workouts.
Social Integration: Built-in social component, users can see their friends' workout for the day. By sharing and viewing other's performance, it can perhaps motivate and foster a friendly competitive environment.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

Some people might not want their workout logs to be viewable by other users so I will add the option to make an account private or only viewable by friends.
